            <div className="accordion-item-desc">
              Mobile optimization is crucial for SEO because search engines
              prioritize mobile-friendly websites. With the increasing use of
              smartphones, search engines like Google consider mobile
              responsiveness as a ranking factor. Websites that provide a
              seamless experience on mobile devices are more likely to rank
              higher in search results.

            <div className="accordion-item-desc">
              Backlinks, or inbound links from other websites to yours, play a
              significant role in SEO. They are considered a vote of confidence
              and can improve a site's authority. Quality over quantity is
              crucial when acquiring backlinks. Strategies for obtaining
              backlinks include creating high-quality content, guest posting,
              reaching out to industry influencers, and participating in
              community activities. It's important to focus on natural and
              ethical link-building practices.
